# 30DaysOfXamarinIOS

I am a Xamarin certified developer and was inspired to put together this set of projects in Xamarin iOS, Xamarin Android and Xamarin Forms as a way to further develop my native Xamarin skills and provide a good mix of projects for those who are learning to code using Xamarin.

I was motivated to create these 30 projects after seeing Allen Wong's [30 Days Of Swift](https://github.com/allenwong/30DaysofSwift) project.

This repository is my Xamarin iOS set of projects.
